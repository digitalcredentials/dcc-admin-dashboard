A system for:

* uploading and managing credential data
* issuing [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) from that data
* notifying recipients by email of credential entitlement
* enabling recipients to collect their credentials

## Features:

- **User Management**: Create and manage user accounts.
- **Credential Management**: Manage individual credentials: searching, viewing, status checking, and revocation.
- **Batch Management**: Manage groups of credentials, such as annual diploma issuances.
- **VC & Email Template Management**: Edit and store templates for credentials and emails.
- **Claim Page**: Web page from which to claim and download credentials to a wallet.
- **VC-API**: Compatible with the Verifiable Credential API exchange endpoints.
- **Deployment**: Fully dockerized for ease of deployment.

## Claim page

NOTE: The claim page is packaged separately. Ultimately you can use any claim page you like, but here's one that works with the dashboard:  [admin-dashboard-claim-page](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/admin-dashboard-claim-page). 

You'd typically configure it to run alongside the admin-dashboard in a docker compose as described in our [deployment guide](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/docs/blob/jc-compose-files/deployment-guide/DCCDeploymentGuide.md)

### Claim page logo

You may want to change the logo on the claim page. You can change the logo on the DCC Claim page by updating the claim page code itself (and rebuilding) or by setting three environment variables when running your instance of this admin dashboard, like this example:

CLAIM_PAGE_LOGO_URL=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Image_test.png
CLAIM_PAGE_LOGO_WIDTH=433
CLAIM_PAGE_LOGO_HEIGHT=291

Every time the claim page loads it calls the dashboard to ask for these images. If they are set, the claim page uses the returned image and dimensions.
